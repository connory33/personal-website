                <h4>Water Pump</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="projectOverview subheading">
                <p>This was a project performed in a group of 5 that entailed designing and fabricating a device that could pump 1 liter of water per minute against gravity. Any type of pump could be designed, and it was all to be fabricated from aluminum stock and standard parts (o-rings, bearings, etc.) using a mill and lathe.</p>

                <p>Our group was initially told to look into 3 different kinds of pumps and generate preliminary designs for them. I chose to look into piston pumps for their reliability and ease of manufacturing. After comparison of our ideas, the group decided to use my idea. I took the lead on building my preliminary design in Fusion360. From there, I helped delegate different components of the project to my team members. Personally, I created detailed design for and then fabricated the scotch yoke mechanism. In addition, myself and one other team member computed the cost estimate, organized acquiring materials, and assembled the BOM for the project. The rest of the team performed their roles great as well and we ended up with a pump that moved 5 L/min.</p>

                <p>Technically, this project improved my design, CAD, and machining skills. However, it also was a great exercise for some more intangible abilities. This is one of few group engineering projects I've been a part of, and learning to delegate and cooperate in an engineering team is something I want to improve and excel at. I also was able to take a product all the way from ideation to completion and testing, something that students don't get a lot of in normal curriculum.</p>
