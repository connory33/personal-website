                    Our task was to make a pump that could move 1 liter of water per minute against gravity. We could use any pump type (piston, 
                    peristaltic, etc.) but had to fabricate it ourselves from aluminum stock and standard parts (o-rings, bearings, etc.) using a mill
                    and lathe. Our group initially split up to research the pros and cons of the various feasible types and prepare an initial CAD design
                    for the type we researched. I researched piston pumps, which we decided to use for their reliability and relatively simple fabrication.
                    Specifically, we chose a two-cylinder reciprocating pump powered by a scotch yoke mechanism.

                <p>
                    After adding more detail to and improving the CAD design, we assembled a BOM and bought the necessary materials. Then it was a relatively
                    easy fabrication process except for the scotch yoke, which had to have its thickness substatially reduced with the lathe. After assembly
                    and testing, we ended up with a pump that moved 5 L/min.
                </p>

                    I really enjoyed this project because it was fun to do something hands-on, especially given that we were able to take it all the way from
                    research and design to a finished and working pump that we could see in action. It was a very valuable experience from that perspective
                    and also in terms of getting practice working with an engineering team in a practical environment that included things like formal BOMs,
                    order forms, and cost estimates.
                    <!-- Technically, this project improved my design, CAD, and machining skills. However, it also was a great exercise for some more intangible
                     abilities. This is one of few group engineering projects I've been a part of, and learning to delegate and cooperate in an engineering
                      team is something I want to improve and excel at. I also was able to take a product all the way from ideation to completion and testing,
                       something that students don't get a lot of in normal curriculum. -->
