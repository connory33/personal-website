                My name is Connor Young and I'm from Palo Alto, CA. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Business from Cornell University
                and a Master's in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell Tech. I'm a logical and quantitative-minded person that enjoys 
                using data and engineering to solve complex problems and inform decision-making. I aim to pursue data science as a career, and am especially 
                interested in opportunities that combine engineering and analytics with my passion for the sports industry.

                Our task was to make a pump that could move 1 liter of water per minute against gravity. We could use any pump type (piston, 
                peristaltic, etc.) but had to fabricate it ourselves from aluminum stock and standard parts (o-rings, bearings, etc.) using a mill
                and lathe. Our group initially split up to research the pros and cons of the various feasible types and prepare an initial CAD design
                for the type we researched. I researched piston pumps, which we decided to use for their reliability and relatively simple fabrication.
                Specifically, we chose a two-cylinder reciprocating pump powered by a scotch yoke mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
                After adding more detail to and improving the CAD design, we assembled a BOM and bought the necessary materials. Then it was a relatively
                easy fabrication process except for the scotch yoke, which had to have its thickness substatially reduced with the lathe. After assembly
                and testing, we ended up with a pump that moved 5 L/min.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed this project because it was fun to do something hands-on, especially given that we were able to take it all the way from
                research and design to a finished and working pump that we could see in action. It was a very valuable experience from that perspective
                and also in terms of getting practice working with an engineering team in a practical environment that included things like formal BOMs,
                order forms, and cost estimates.
                <!-- Technically, this project improved my design, CAD, and machining skills. However, it also was a great exercise for some more intangible
                 abilities. This is one of few group engineering projects I've been a part of, and learning to delegate and cooperate in an engineering
                  team is something I want to improve and excel at. I also was able to take a product all the way from ideation to completion and testing,
                   something that students don't get a lot of in normal curriculum. -->
